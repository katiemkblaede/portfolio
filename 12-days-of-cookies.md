Happy holidays! I am thrilled to share with you my latest project, combining three of my favorite things: design, illustration, and COOKIES. Beginning soon, I will release a new cookie recipe card once a day for 12 days, which you can download on this page for free. (Do you have Christmas shopping to do? Are you just impatient? Visit my store and purchase the recipe card pack now!)

Starting now, you can download a card with baking tips to make your cookies amazing. Follow @katiemkblaede on Instagram to know immediately when the next recipe is available.
