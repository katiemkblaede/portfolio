Happy holidays! I am thrilled to share with you my latest project, combining four of my favorite things: design, illustration, Christmas, and COOKIES. Beginning November 28, 2015, I will release a new cookie recipe card once a day for 12 days, which you can download on this page for free by clicking or tapping the graphic for each recipe. <!-- (Do you have Christmas shopping to do? Are you just impatient? [Visit my store](/store) and purchase the recipe card pack now!) -->

In addition, you can <a href="/downloads/12-days-of-cookies/0-CookieBakingTips.pdf" download="KatieMKBlaede-CookieBakingTips.pdf">download a card with baking tips</a> to make your cookies amazing. Follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katiemkblaede" target="_blank">@katiemkblaede</a> on Instagram to know immediately when the next recipe is available.
