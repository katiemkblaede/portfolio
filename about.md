I’m Katie M. K. Blaede (pronounced “BLAY-dee”), a designer and illustrator. I’m on a mission to keep the tactile experience of design alive! I think it’s wrong that much of contemporary graphic design has become sterile and void of human touch. My goal is to form a personal connection with others through the experience of design and illustration.

I am currently employed as the Senior Design + Production Intern at 5280 Publishing. I majored in Graphic Design at the University of Northern Iowa and graduated _cum laude_ in December 2014. I currently reside in Denver, Colorado with my wonderful spouse <a href="http://cassidyjames.com" target="_blank"> Cassidy James Blaede</a>.
